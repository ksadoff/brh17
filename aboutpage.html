<h1><p class= "mission"style="color: black; font-size: 30 px" > bloop! was created by 4 Cornell University undergraduates: Elisabeth Crotty, Catherine Sadoff, Beaubeaubeau Si, and Cassandra York. Developed to be a crowd sourced educational platform in which anyone can post educational content, bloop! is your go-to site for collaborative learning. The site consists of videos created or posted by our users and are grouped into various categories and subcategories via hashtags characterizing the video. Viewers can upvote and downvote videos which will affect how close the video is to the top of the webpage. Users can post in the discussion section with requests for specific content, as well as save videos or video authors as favorites. Nonusers can view all the site has to offer.

Advertisments on the site will go towards funding the domain, as well as donating to educational equality organizations worldwide.
